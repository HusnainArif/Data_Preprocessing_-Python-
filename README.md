# Data_Preprocessing_Python
data_preprocessing.py script cleans up the dataset before it is fed into a machine learning model. Missing Data is taken care of and Categorical Data is encoded. Dataset is split into training set and test set, and feature scaling is performed to put all of the variables on the same scale.

The final_data_preprocessing_template.py file performs only two features; Splitting the dataset between training data and test data, and Feature Scaling. Since, these two operations are most commonly requried to be performed on the dataset before it can be utilized by a python machine learning libraries.
